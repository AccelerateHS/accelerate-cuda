This directory contains some utilities to use Accelerate together with the CUDA
backend from within GHCi.

Copy (or symlink) the wrapper script 'ghci' to the root directory of the
accelerate-cuda source tree. You might also like to copy the file 'dot_ghci' to
'.ghci' to the root directory. It assumes that we have the base library
installed in the parent directory.
